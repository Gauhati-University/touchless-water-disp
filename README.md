# Touchless Water Dispenser
## Description
Touchless Water Dispenser using Arduino and a Solenoid valve automatically opens and closes a faucet so that we can wash our hands safely and prevent spread of coronavirus disease. For detecting our hand when placed just below the valve we use an ultrasonic sensor and that leads to opening the valve.

* Diode: 1N4001
* Resistor: 220 ohm

## Working Principle

### Sensor:

The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor comes with both reciever and transmitter modules. The sensor uses sonar to determine the distance to an object.
1. The transmitter transmit an high frequency signal of 40kHz.
2. The transmitted signal travels through air and reflects when incident on the surface of the object (in this case our hand).
3. The reciever recieves the reflected signal.

| Pins | Usage |
|:----:|:--------------:|
| VCC | +5V |
| Trig | TRIGGER(Input) |
| Echo | ECHO (Output) |
| GND | GROUND |

To generate the ultrasound signal the **Trig** pin must be HIGH for 10Âµs.The transmitter will then send out an 8 cycle sonic burst which will travel at the speed of sound and will be received by the receiver. The **Echo** Pin emits a pulse whose width is in proportion to the distance travelled by the sound wave. The time duration between transmission and reception can be used to determine the distance to the object as the speed of sound is known.

The solenoid valve is which is normally closed.It is controlled by the microcontroller (Arduino Uno) using a relay. The relay in this case is in normally open and connects the AC power source to the Solenoid valve depending upon the signal coming from the Arduino.
* The transistor used in with the relay is used a switch. The transistor is ON when digital Pin 11 is in HIGH state leading to flow of current through the coils of the relay.
* The energized magnetic coils of the relay connects the AC power to the Solenoid valve.
* The power supplied opens the valve by energizing the solenoid coil and allows the liquid to flow through it.
* When the digital Pin 11 is in LOW state the transistor is OFF leading to no flow of current but the energy stored relay coils of the form of magnetic field leads to spike in the voltage across the relay coil that might damage the transistor.
* To prevent the transistor from damge, a diode, also called [flywheel diode](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/relay-switch-circuit.html), clamps the reverse voltage across the coil to about 0.7V dissipating the stored energy and protecting the switching transistor.
## Code

The code can be found at [arduino.ino](https://github.com/Gauhati-University/touchless-water-disp/blob/master/Program/arduino/arduino.ino).

### Working of the code

#### Pins used:
 
The variables for the trigger and echo pin called **trig** and **echo**, respectively. The trigger pin of HC SR04 is connected to digital pin 9 of arduino, and the echo pin is connected to digital pin 8. The variable for controllong the state of the solenoid valve is called Valve and is connected to digital Pin 11:
```
const int trig = 9;
const int echo = 8;
const int Valve = 11;
```

#### Variables:
`duration` variable will save the time between emission and reception of signal and `distance` variable will save the distance between the Ultrasonic sensor and the object which is calculated using the `duration` variable:
```
long duration;
int distance;
```

#### setup():
The `trig` is set as Output, the `echo` is set as Input and the `Valve` pin as Output.

```
pinMode(trig, OUTPUT); // Sets the trig as an Output
pinMode(echo, INPUT); // Sets the echo as an Input
pinMode(Valve, OUTPUT); // Configure the pin connected to the Valve as OUTPUT
```

#### loop():
The Ultrasonic sensor is triggered by sending a HIGH pulse of 10 microseconds through the `trig` pin. But, before that, a short LOW pulse is send through it to ensure that we get a clean HIGH pulse:
```
 // Clear the trig
  digitalWrite(trig, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  
  // Set the trig on HIGH state for 10 micro seconds
  digitalWrite(trig, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trig, LOW);
 ```
 
#### Reading the Echo pin of the sensor:
Now, the `echo` pin is read which recieves a HIGH pulse from the **Echo pin** of the sensor whose pulse width is equal to the duration of time (in mircosecond) between transmission and reception of its echo from the object and the assigned to the variable `duration`.
 ```
 duration = pulseIn(echo, HIGH);
 ```
 
 #### Calculating the distance:
 The distance between the Object and the sensor is calculated using the formula below:
 ```
 distance= duration*0.034/2;
 ```
 
 #### Condition to open the valve:
 Now, a range of distance is given as a condition between which the object should be placed for the valve to open. This condition could be set according to requirement.
 ```
  if(distance>10 && distance<60){
    digitalWrite(Valve, LOW); //Turns on the solenoid water valve
  }
  
  else{
    digitalWrite(Valve, HIGH); //Turns off the solenoid water valve
   }
 ```
