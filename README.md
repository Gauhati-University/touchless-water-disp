# Touchless Water Dispenser
## Project Description
Touchless Water Dispenser using Arduino and a Solenoid valve automatically opens and closes a faucet so that we can wash our hands safely and prevent spread of coronavirus disease. For detecting our hand when placed just below the valve we use an ultrasonic sensor and that leads to opening the valve.

## Working Principle

The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor comes with both reciever and transmitter modules. The sensor uses sonar to determine the distance to an object.
1. The transmitter (Trig pin) transmit an high frequency signal of 40kHz.
2. The transmitted signal travels through air and reflects when incident on the surface of the object (in this case our hand).
3. The reciever (Echo pin) recieves the reflected signal.

| Pins | Usage |
|:----:|:--------------:|
| VCC | +5V |
| Trig | TRIGGER(Input) |
| Echo | ECHO (Output) |
| GND | GROUND |

Now to generate the ultrasound signal the Trig pin must be HIGH for 10Âµs which will send out an 8 cycle sonic burst which will travel at the speed sound and it will be received in the Echo Pin. The Echo Pin will output the time in microseconds the sound wave traveled. The time duration between transmission and reception can be used to determine the distance to the object as the speed of sound is known.

## Code

The code in [arduino.uno](https://github.com/Gauhati-University/touchless-water-disp/blob/master/Program/arduino/arduino.ino) needs to be uploaded to the Arduino IDE.

### Working of the code

#### Defining the pins to be used:
 
The variables for the trigger and echo pin called trigPin and echoPin, respectively. The trigger pin is connected to digital Pin 9, and the echo pins is connected to digital Pin 8. The variable for solenoid valve is called Valve and is connected to digital Pin 11:
```
const int trigPin = 9;
const int echoPin = 8;
const int Valve = 11;
```

#### Defining the variable required:
Also two variables `duration` and `distance` are define. The `duration` variable will save the time between emission and reception of signal and `distance` variable will save the distance between the Ultrasonic sensor and the object which is calculated using the `duration` variable:
```
long duration;
int distance;
```

#### Defining the setup() function:
In the `setup()` function, the `triPin` is set as Output , the `echoPin` is set as Input and the `Valve` pin as Output.

```
pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT); // Sets the trigPin as an Output
pinMode(echoPin, INPUT); // Sets the echoPin as an Input
pinMode(Valve, OUTPUT); // Configure the pin connected to the Valve as OUTPUT
```

#### Defining the loop() function:
In the loop() funcion,the Ultrasonic sensor is triggered by sending a HIGH pulse of 10 microseconds through the `triPin`. But, before that,a short LOW pulse is send through it to ensure that we get a clean HIGH pulse:
```
 // Clear the trigPin
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  
  // Set the trigPin on HIGH state for 10 micro seconds
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
 ```
 
#### Reading the Echo pin of the sensor:
Now, the `echoPin` is read which recieves a HIGH pulse from the **Echo pin** of the sensor whose duration is equal to the duration of time (in mircosecond) between transmission and reception of its echo from the object and the assigned to the variable `duration`.
 ```
 duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
 ```
 
 #### Calculating the distance:
 The distance between the Object and the sensor is calculated using the formula below:
 ```
 distance= duration*0.034/2;
 ```
 
 #### Condition to open the valve:
 Now, a range of distance is given as a condition between which the object should be placed for the valve to open. This condition could be set according to requirement.
 ```
  if(distance>10 && distance<50){
    digitalWrite(Valve, LOW); //Turns on the solenoid water valve
  }
  
  else{
    digitalWrite(Valve, HIGH); //Turns off the solenoid water valve
   }
 ```
